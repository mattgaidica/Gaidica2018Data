% we recorded 366 units over 30 sessions in 5 rats

% these are the rats
subjectNames = analysisConf.subjects;
% these are the neuron names based on the rat/recording wire
neuronNames = analysisConf.neurons;
% these are the session names (there are multiple units per session)
sessionNames = analysisConf.sessionNames;

% all_ts are all the timestamps from every unit, probably not that useful

% all_tsPeths are +/-1s peri-event timestamps for each unit-trial
